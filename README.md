# PlaySave: an electronic toy and a mobile app to teach children ages 8-14 to save and invest money. 

I designed a user interface prototype for a mobile application that would communicate via Bluetooth with multiple smart boards, which, when coupled, extend the game's capabilities.

Found in this repository is the code for each of the Arduinos used on this prototype.
